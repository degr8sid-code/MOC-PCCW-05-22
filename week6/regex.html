        // Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", 
        // are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. 
        // Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read 
        // because they use special characters to make more complex, 
        // flexible matches.

        //EXAMPLE 1
        let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
        let testRegex = /Code/;
        console.log(testRegex.test(testStr));

        //EXAMPLE 2
        let testStr2 = "Repeat, Repeat, Repeat";
        let ourRegex = /Repeat/;
        console.log(testStr2.match(ourRegex));
