# Week 12

In * Module 12: Introduction To React *, you’ll create a simple React component, which is the foundational building block of a web page built using React. You’ll use the ES6 features you practiced in the last module to write clean, concise code in JSX, the JavaScript syntax extension you will use for React. By the end of the React section, you’ll be able to track button clicks on basic React components.
